## Helvetireader Extension ##

This is a minor update to the Helvetireader 2 extension as a Safari 5 extension. It is signed and written by me (dfayram@gmail.com), but the original work was done by [Hicksdesign](http://hicksdesign.co.uk/), and they deserve mad props for it.

As far as I know, this is the most straightforward way to actually pass a preference from your extension preferences to an injected script.

Thanks to tobstone@github for adding .de to the list of supported domains.
